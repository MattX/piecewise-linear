# piecewise-linear

## Piecewise linear function manipulation utilities

This crate provides utilities to manipulate continuous functions that
can be represented as a collection of linear functions, each operating
on a disjoint domain.

It uses [geo](https://github.com/georust/geo) for geometric primitives
and types.

### Features

- [x] Efficient iterator over inflection points of a two functions
- [x] Shrink and expand function domain 
- [ ] Negation
- [ ] Sum
- [ ] Numerical integration
