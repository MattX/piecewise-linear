# piecewise-linear

## Piecewise linear function manipulation utilities

This crate provides utilities to manipulate continuous functions that
can be represented as a collection of linear functions, each operating
on a disjoint domain.

It uses [geo](https://github.com/georust/geo) for geometric primitives
and types.
